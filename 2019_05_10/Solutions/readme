Two different solutions for the Pythagoras coding dojo.

- Triangle.java: a few methods
- TriangleTestUsingLoop.java: various test cases for the triangle.
- Test case TriangleTestUsingLoop.countSolutionsInMap is a solution to the coding dojo task.
  It is implemented with 3 nested loops.
  This results in reasonable timing for maxPerimeter = 1000.
  Note: a naive / straightforward brute-force implementation would use 4 nested loops
  and would need several seconds.   
- TriangleTestUsingMaps.java: an alternate solution to the coding dojo task.
  Using only 2 nested loops, and two hash maps.
  This solution scales much better for very large maxPerimeter.
